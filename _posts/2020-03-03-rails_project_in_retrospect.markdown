Rails has been a fascinating framework to learn because more than any of the concepts I've learned so far at Flatiron, the more I learn about Rails the more I realize how little I know. It has been wild, overwhelming, and exciting to work with the interesting combination of Rails language and a plethora of helpers and additions that is Rails. It's clear to me that I've just tapped the edge of the possibilities that Rails opens up, and I'm more than eager to learn more. As I finish up my Rails project, here are a few takeaways that I want to remember. 

**1. There are a lot of right ways, a lot of wrong ways, and a lot of ways in between. **

More than anything else I've done so far with Flatiron, my Rails project helped me realize the sheer scope of options, methods, and approaches available to me. There are many ways to solve a problem, so many ways to design a working app, and not all are created equally. Spending time looking through the various solutions suggested on StackOverflow is an amazing way to see the sheer volume of different approaches and ideas. I find it refreshing to remember that coding is not a single learned skill, but a world of choice, creativity, and nuances that we can navigate from as we make our way as coders. 

**2. Understanding the database is crucial. **

By far the most time-consuming part of my project was the initial ideation, in which I spent hours upon hours working out the possible models and relationships that I could create. Even when it comes to our models, there are many different ways to approach them, and the way we approach them has a huge impact on the rest of our app. I spent a lot of time working with a mentor to understand the many-to-many construct and join tables in general, and this time spent was the key to the rest of my project-building going relatively smoothly. At one point, I did end up having to create another table and relationship in order to satisfy a requirement, and it took a huge amount of thought and consideration. I still feel that I have a fairly tenuous grasp on complex relationships and their intricacies, and this is something that I would like to improve upon as I move forward. 

**3. In MVC, everything has a job, but every job isn't for every thing.
**

I really enjoy the MVC structure of Rails because it so clearly deliniates what is, and what isn't, the function of each working part. Imagining approaching my app without the MVC structure of models, views, controllers, and routes, evokes such a feeling of chaos that I can't even imagine approaching it. I love how controllers are only responsible for, well, controlling the direction of the page flow, models are only responsible for managing their relationships and holding model-specific methods, and views are only responsible for rendering what the user will interact with. The cleanliness of the setup can make something very complex seem much more manageable. Simultaneously, if responsibilities start bleeding into the wrong areas (long methods in controllers, complex Ruby in views), things get sticky real fast! The deeper I got into my project, the easier it became to accidentally place something in its wrong spot and spiral into confusion from there. With the MVC model always in mind, it was easier to build a cleaner app that had less errors in the moment and required less refactoring in the end.


My final takeaway, I suppose, is that I really enjoy working in Rails. I've just tapped the surface but I feel that I have learned how to weild a pretty powerful tool, and that feels good! I can't wait to learn more.
