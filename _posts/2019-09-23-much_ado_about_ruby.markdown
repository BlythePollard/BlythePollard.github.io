When I told my boss, a former educational coach for a programming bootcamp, that I was in a programming bootcamp myself, she was ecstatic. After a litany of advice tidbits, she asked, "What language are you learning?!"

"Ruby," I told her. 

Her face fell. "Oh. Okay. Ruby is kind of on the out, but I guess it's a good place to start."

It was not the first time I'd heard something like this. I've been following all sorts of coding drama across the internet since I before I started the Flatiron program and have been trying to piece together the rhyme or reason behind the many, many opinions out there. And so far I’ve grasped that there are two things I can count on from the internet: that I will find a Stack Overflow answer to my question (helpful or not, that's another topic) and that everyone, EVERYONE on the internet who programs, has a lot of opinions. 

As a beginner in this world, I just don't feel I have enough knowledge to sort through what I agree with, what I disagree with, what's a quality opinion, and what's worth my time. With that being said, I've been trying to parse through the weeds of the many opinions about Ruby in order to understand the language better--why are some programmers loyalists and others haters? Why is there this rumor of Ruby "dying" that one article backs and the next negates? And what does all of this mean for me? 

So here's what I've got. Let's start with the good. 

Ruby loyalists talk about it like a lovable puppy, and I suppose that it was, in a way, created that way. Yukihiro Matsumoto's development of the language seemed to be, above all, a labor of love. He wanted programmers to have a nice, approachable language and the community that has been created out of Ruby seems equally nice and approachable. A language whose personal tagline is about being nice (MINISWAN) *is* pretty endearing and I'm definitely a sucker for that. 

Another resounding pro of Ruby seem to be its easy readability/writability (people joke that it is basically just English) and its overall simplicity. This post from [Dev.to](http://https://dev.to/zalom/comment/494c) sums it up pretty well: ![](http://https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NQ2v1RXX49FUTrEYrIHC59JsoWXbi4l/view?usp=sharing)

And another meme from r/programminghumor that sums it up well:

Okay, I’m a beginner. I like simple, I like readable. I like nice programmer friends. I like Ruby. So what is this dark side that I keep hearing about?

I’ve noticed two pervasive negative narratives around Ruby. First, the one that my boss had mentioned: Ruby is dying out. Second, that there’s contention between lovers of other languages and lovers of Ruby. So I decided to investigate. 

Regarding the “death of Ruby,” it’s a little unclear where this narrative is stemming from. A response to this narrative found on Forbes (via Quora) states, “The rumors about the demise of Ruby have been circulating the developer world for years and articles prophesying the “death” of Ruby appear with amazing regularity. Yet, the language and its main framework (Ruby on Rails) are safe and sound.” Ruby does appear to have lost some popularity in the last few years, moving down to the 8th or 9th most popular language. It seems that this decline can be attributed to the growing popularity and use of other languages in a very competitive and busy arena. As [this Techrepublic article ](http://https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-death-of-ruby-developers-should-learn-these-languages-instead/) describes, “The evidence is in the jobs: Java, JavaScript, .Net, HTML, and Python topped the list of languages found most often in tech job postings in the past year, according to Indeed, while Ruby came in far down the list, at No. 9.” Okay, so maybe Ruby isn’t the most popular kid in school right now, but she’s still pretty cool. 

Phew--as someone just tapping the surface of Ruby, it was a relief to see that Ruby may have some competition, but it still has a strong developer community, high use in startups, and maintains popularity as a tier 1 programming language. The competition that Ruby faces, though, reminded me of the importance of learning different languages--you can’t put all your eggs in one basket. 

Okay, what about the haters? My conclusion: it’s a weird internet thing. There are a couple of back and forth discussions about whether Ruby is too slow, but most of the contention seems to actually come from tension between groups of language loyalists. I picked up most of these vibes on reddit and funnily enough, when I Googled around, there wasn’t much. Looks like a lot of what I was seeing was just trolling and general groupthink of “my preference is the best preference.” I did find [one article](http://https://medium.com/@jochasinga/why-pythonians-hate-ruby-on-rails-dbfef9ff56a) about why Python loyalists “hate” Ruby. Though the author did lay out some possible reasons for the dichotomy, their general conclusion was about the same as mine: “I feel that it’s a more of psychological than syntactical or pragmatical issues here.” 

After taking a dive into the online culture of Ruby (or what I could understand of it as a beginner), I can walk away with a couple of things. First, the internet has a lot of opinions. Second, there are a LOT of languages and frameworks out there to learn. And third, I’m glad that I’m starting my journey with the lovable puppy of the group.
