For my Sinatra final project, I created a Model-View-Controller application that allows users to manage their goals. The idea for this application had taken form in my head long before I got to Sinatra; at work, I support self-paced students as they work through a program that is paid for by their employer. These students work with their employer for the benefit, the school for their classes and academic support, and my company for coaching support and troubleshooting. It's a lot to keep track of in itself, not to mention the challenges of being in a self-paced online program. My team has dreamt of a webpage that could encompass all student support: a place that holds all important resources from their employer, the school, and my company, as well as a way to track and maintain their progress as they work. 

With this as my inspiration, I designed the Student Resource Website. 

Here are a few of my takeaways, things that I've learned and would like to remember as I continue on to the next phase of my curriculum. 

1) **It helps to ground your ideas in reality**. This website is certainly a V1 and does not include true links to all necessary resources, but being able to build my final project on a tangible concept that I deal with on a daily basis was extremely helpful in grounding my work in reality, especially considering the complexity of relationships between models, views, controllers, and the Activerecord database.  

2) **Plan it out first**. This was absolutely crucial. I used[ Lucidchart](http://https://www.lucidchart.com/) to build out a visual of my full project. I would imagine that there is a best practice for mapping, but I just did what looked right to me and ended up with a clear, simple framework for my project that guided me through its creation and helped me simplify when things got too complex. 

3) **Commit, often**. It probably took me under 10 cumulative hours to complete my MVC project, and during that time, I felt like I was committing often. Only when I finished and looked at my commits did I realize I had only committed changes 7 times! Unthinkingly, I got into the practice of committing only when I was finishing my work for the day, like saving a file before exiting. In the end, I only had a record of 7 changes I made while I built the entire application--yikes! This was a huge wakeup call and reminder that I need to create a workflow that keeps me on task to commit quite often. 

4) **CSS is a world that I have not explored**. As I looked through the layout.erb stylesheet that was provided by setting up my application with [Corneal](http://https://thebrianemory.github.io/corneal/), I noticed how much of the layout was created through referencing outside sources. Corneal used Ajax in the layout.erb file, and the project instructions suggested CSS libraries such as [Bulma](http://https://bulma.io/) and [Bootstrap](http://https://getbootstrap.com/). As I entered into the world of stylesheets and CSS modification, I realized how little I truly know about designing a good-looking website. For this project, I relied on the layout of Corneal, but as I spend more time modifying and improving the project, I have quite a lot to learn about CSS. I hope to spend more time learning and practicing CSS with external resources: [CodeAcademy](http://https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) and ![](W3Schools http://https://www.w3schools.com/) may be a good place to start.

The beautiful part of creating something is that through the process, you continue to learn what you could have done better. I'm proud of my work on this project and I'm also proud of the shortcomings and confusion I experienced, as these will only contribute to my learning in the long run.

Thanks for reading!
